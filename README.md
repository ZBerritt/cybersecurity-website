# Traffic Light Hacking - The 5 Ds of Hacking
**This was part of a school project in collaboration with Lockheed Martin.**

An educational cybersecurity website aimed at students from grades 8-12

Fully operational site: **https://zberritt.github.io/cybersecurity-website**


## Goals
* Expose students from grades 8-12 on the dangers of hacking
* Expose students to the basics of cybersecurity

## Hosting
The files are pure HTML, CSS and JS with no backend components. Files should be compatible with any hosting solution (apache, nginx, github pages, etc). 

### Github Pages
Since our code is hosted on github, forking the code to host on github pages is very simple. For more info: https://pages.github.com/
